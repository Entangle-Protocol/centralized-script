## Rebalancing events
### Event A Buy:
1. Router checks if it is enough liquidity on IDEX
2. It is enough liq to provide synths for user, but after trade there would not be enough
3. ROUTER: EventA {type: 'Buy'} fires
4. Backend script catches event
5. Sends USDC from IDEX on chain X via Bridge protocol to Liquidity pool on chain Y (send Tx to Router to start bridging)  
#### Methods:
    bridgeToChain(
            address token,
            string memory to,
            uint256 amount,
            uint256 toChainID,
            string memory anycallProxy,
            bytes calldata data
        )
6. POOL: Deposit fires
7. Backend script catches event
8. Ask Router to deposit liquidity to SynthChef (send Tx to Router)  
#### Methods:
    depositFromPool(
            uint256 pid,
            uint256 amount,
            uint256 poolID
        )
9. ROUTER: Deposit fires
10. Backend script catches event
11. Ask SynthFactory to mint synths to IDEX (send Tx to SynthFactory or Router)  
#### Methods
    mint(
            uint256 _chainId,
            address _synthChef,
            uint256 _pid,

```js
IRouter {
    IEventA {
        type: string | bytes32[] //type of event: Buy || Sell
        amount: number | uint256 //amount of USDC/SynhLp to rebalance
        pid: number | uint256 //pid of farm which rebalance
    }
    
    IEventBC {
        type: string | bytes32[]; //type of event: Buy || Sell
        amount: uint256; //amount token to exchange (USDC or SynthLP)
        pid: number | uint256 //pid of farm which rebalance
        user: address; //address to delivery USDC or SynthLPs

    loan(uint256 amount, uint256 opId)

}
```
### Pool
<!-- - BridgeDepositEvent - Event fires when USDC came to the contract. -->
- Deposit - Event fires when USDC came to the contract.
```js
IPool {
    IDeposit {
        amount: number | uint256; //amount of USDC 
        opId: number | uint256; //unique Operation id;
        type: string | bytes32; //type of deposit
    }

    withdrawToken(uint256 amount, address to)
}
```
### SynthChef
- Deposit - Event fires when USDC was successfuly deposited to farm.
- Withdraw - Event fires when USDC was successfuly withdrawed from farm.

```
### SynthFactory
```js
IFactory {
    mint(
        uint256 _chainId,
        address _synthChef,
        uint256 _pid,
        uint256 _amount,
